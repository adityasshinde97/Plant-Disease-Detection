Plant Disease Detection
Plant Disease Recognition System using Deep Learning and Streamlit
This is a deep learning-based web application designed to detect and diagnose plant diseases from leaf images. Built with TensorFlow and Streamlit, the system enables farmers, gardeners, and researchers to quickly identify diseases and receive actionable suggestions for treatment and prevention.
Features
AI-Powered Prediction: Utilizes a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify 38 classes of plant diseases across fruits, vegetables, and grains.
Image Upload & Analysis: Users can upload images of leaves, and the model will predict the disease class along with confidence scores.
Detailed Insights: Provides symptoms, preventive measures, and pesticide recommendations for each disease.
Fast & Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit for a seamless and responsive user experience.
Model Trained on Diverse Dataset: Trained with over 87,000 images, ensuring robust performance across multiple plant species.
Dataset
Training Samples: 70,295 images
Validation Samples: 17,572 images
Test Samples: 33 images

Dataset includes healthy and diseased leaves of crops such as Apple, Grape, Tomato, Corn, Potato, and more.
